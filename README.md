## Hi there 👋

<!--Hi, I'm Ralph K. Hyacinthe 👋
⭐️ About Me:

I’m a senior at Colgate University, double majoring in Computer Science and Political Science, with plans to graduate in December 2025. My curiosity about how systems—both technical and societal—operate has driven me to pursue an interdisciplinary academic path. I love exploring how technology can solve complex problems and create meaningful change, whether through designing innovative software solutions or understanding how political systems shape decision-making.

Through Political Science, I’ve developed strong analytical, communication, and problem-solving skills that help me collaborate effectively and articulate ideas clearly. In Computer Science, I’ve gained hands-on experience building impactful projects like FitsFit, an online tool for personalized clothing fit recommendations that uses Flask, React, and MongoDB.
💻 Tech Stack:

Programming Languages: Java, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, R, HTML, CSS
Technologies & Tools: React, Flask, SpringBoot, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, REST APIs, .NET, TailwindCSS

I’ve worked extensively with full-stack technologies, particularly Flask and React, to develop scalable and user-focused applications. Projects like ShopEase and FitsFit showcase my ability to design end-to-end solutions that enhance user experiences. I’ve also explored backend development with SpringBoot and PostgreSQL, implementing secure REST APIs and scalable databases.
🚀 What I’m Working On Now:

I’m currently enhancing my understanding of machine learning and AI, especially their applications in creating interactive tools like chatbots and recommendation systems. These emerging technologies fascinate me, and I’m eager to incorporate them into future projects.
